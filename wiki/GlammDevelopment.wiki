#summary GLAMM development in GWT development mode.

= Introduction =

GWT already has a great [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCompilingAndDebugging.html#launching_in_dev_mode introduction] for developing apps in development mode, but there are a few details one needs to manage when developing for GLAMM.

= GLAMM in GWT Development Mode =

Here's how to get GLAMM up and running in development mode:

# Open up the SSH tunnel to a MicrobesOnline server.

# Make sure the topmost glamm directory is selected in Eclipse's Package Explorer.

# Click on "Debug As..." in the Eclipse toolbar.

# Copy the URL from the "Development Mode" tab at the bottom of the screen into Firefox's URL bar - hit enter.

# Install the developer plugin, if necessary (this wil only happen the first time Firefox is started.)

# Wait... and I do mean wait... development mode is _slow_.

# Voila - GLAMM is (eventually) running!

= Stopping a development mode instance =

Click the red square icon in the development mode tab toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

= Committing code to SVN =

After you've made some changes and are reasonably satisfied they work, it makes sense to put them into the repository.  Simply right-click on the topmost directory containing all your changes in the Package Explorer, and select Team->Commit... and follow the directions in the dialog box.
