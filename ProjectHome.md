The Genome-Linked Application for Metabolic Maps (GLAMM) is a unified web interface for visualizing metabolic networks, reconstructing metabolic networks from annotated genome data, visualizing experimental data in the context of metabolic networks, and investigating the construction of novel, transgenic pathways.  This simple, user-friendly interface is tightly integrated with the comparative genomics tools of [MicrobesOnline](http://www.microbesonline.org).  GLAMM is available for free to the scientific community at [glamm.lbl.gov](http://glamm.lbl.gov).
